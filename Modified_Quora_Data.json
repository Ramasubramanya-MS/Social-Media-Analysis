But the precise impact depends on a lot more than vegan choices.\nIf a vegan chooses mainly local and sustainable and minimally processed plant-based foods, that has an enormous impact for good.\nBut if another vegan chooses long distance foods that were sprayed with pesticides, packaged in plastic, and kept in a freezer for a long time, the impact will be negative.\nWalking or driving to the store also makes a difference.\nIn the final analysis, both vegans and non vegans can do a host of things that have a major impact on climate, and the absence or presence of animal products is only one of many possible positive choices.\n441 viewsView upvotesAnswer requested by\nReese Greiner",

The exact number depends on the details\u2014eggs have a pretty modest carbon footprint, while berries flown across the world have a high one\u2014but it works out to something in that ballpark on average. Food production represents about a quarter of carbon emissions, so a vegan diet leads to a roughly twelve percent reduction in personal carbon emissions.\nThat\u2019s not trivial.

However, being vegan is still helpful when those that can do it. Even just increasing your consumption of plant-based food without entirely cutting out meat and dairy can help. The vast majority of calories grown in plants are lost when they\u2019re fed to livestock; eating them directly is far more efficient. Additionally, cows burp a lot of methane, which is a far more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide; ruminants have very different digestive systems than most other mammals.\nEating less beef reduces emissions directly.

            "text": "Related\nWill going vegan help slow down global warming? How?\nBy cutting out animals as a caloric middleman.\nMost animal products are produced using food that would be completely, 100% edible for humans. Farmed fish are often fed soybeans. Cows are fed corn. Both of those are usually farmed using more fossil fuels as input than the plants absorb from the atmosphere (farming, right now, is a net-carbon-producing endeavor, despite all of the photosynthesis of the plants farmed).\nModern, concentrated meat production increases the amount of high-value land needed for farming intensive dietary staples. So if you cut out the meat, and just eat the plants directly, you\u2019re freeing up money to buy better, healthier foods (such as fruits and vegetables) and, simultaneously, freeing up farmland to provide those crops. The farmland that would otherwise be used for cattle feed can instead produce nuts and berries and other delicious, healthy foods. And foods like that, foods with embodied carbon in the field, in the form of tree trunks and shrub stems, are less carbon-intensive.\nSo going vegan cuts carbon production twofold: it decreases the amount of fossil fuels needed to produce the food you eat, and it simultaneously encourages the conversion of farmlands towards foods that are higher-value and less carbon-intensive.\nTo be clear, I am not vegan, and never will be. I like fish too much, and certainly, fish that you catch yourself from a well-managed lake is completely, 100% sustainable. All these benefits are also available to those who still eat red meat too, but only for the people who know exactly how much fossil fuels it took to raise their meat. It is generally sound moral policy to know the consequences of your actions, and it is very easy for vegans to know that they are not eating any unsustainable meat.\n327 viewsView upvotes",

The difference is a time delay that does not affect global emissions which in any event are prevented from having a global significance by winters that are caused by the obliquity of the Earth\u2019s spin axis that affects the illumination of the poles, just as summers do. If they do so over 41,000 years they may be taken to control the global mean temperatures over shorter periods of time too.\nThat\u2019s where the the variations in the global mean temperatures are coming from - small perturbations in the Earth\u2019s orbits caused mostly by the orbits Jupiter and Saturn with cycles taking less than a century and Uranus and Neptune causing cycles of less than 2 centuries and vary the obliquity of the Earth\u2019s spin axis slightly, called wobbles.\nRising CO2 at Mauna Loa comes from the declining eccentricity of the Earth\u2019s obits increasing the speed of the Earth\u2019s rotation that is making the Earth so very different from Venus where the length of 1 day is 243 Earth days with a thick massive atmosphere that is making its surface very hot and a dead planet.\nIt is the supersonic equatorial speed of the Earth\u2019s rotation (1,677 km/h, 1,042 mph) that controls the atmospheric CO2 content by spinning some of it out to the thermosphere where the sun turns it into plasma. From there the ionised carbon atoms rain down and form polycyclic hydrocarbons and amino acids, which is what started life on Earth in the early atmosphere as prokaryotes.

            "text": "Related\nCan becoming a vegan save the planet from permanent damage done from climate change?\nNo. The opposite is true. There is a kind of agriculture called regenerative agriculture that can reverse damage to the environment. It involves raising livestock and people eating meat.\nCurrent conventional agriculture uses artificial fertilizer which is made from non-renewable resources and creates a huge amount of emissions. It destroys soil, air, and water. Regenerative agriculture, on the other hand, functions more like an natural ecosystem. Ruminants graze on grassland and their manure acts as a natural fertilizer which builds up soil quality and sequesters carbon. Grassland is healthier when animals are properly grazed on it which in turn improves air and water. People then eat the ruminants or use them as a source of milk.\nWe certainly do need to stop producing both animal and plant based food the way that we currently do. It is destructive and inefficient. But all the vegan factoids about how bad it is to eat meat are based on assuming that food will continue to be produced this way. Merely refraining from eating animal products while continuing to raise plants with conventional agriculture is not going to fix problems with the environment. All agriculture, both plant and animal, needs reform. And if we do this, then eating meat will not be harmful to the environment, but rather beneficial.\n592 viewsView upvotes\n1 of 2 answers\n10\n2",

Truthfully I had thought about going back to eating meat a few years. I found that being vegetarian was sometimes counterproductive to the reasons I became one in the first place. One of the reasons was to reduce the environmental impact of meat production but there were times when I threw food away because it might have lard or chicken stock in it. Throwing food away is more wasteful than not. I also became a vegetarian for health reasons but there were times when I was traveling when the only vegetarian option at a restaurant was a rich cheesy pasta dish but they also served grilled fish and steamed vegetables which would be healthier. The reason I ended up going back to eating meat was to try the trendy paleo diet to lose weight. The diet didn't really work out for me. It is really hard to stay on and I didn't lose much weight. When I started eating meat again I ate a lot of it because of the novelty of it but now I'm cutting back. I don't think I'll ever go back to being a strict vegetarian. I think I'll eventually be a flexitarian or a near-vegetarian that eats mostly vegetarian most of the time.

            "text": "Related\nCan becoming a vegan save the planet from permanent damage done from climate change?\nNo. The opposite is true. There is a kind of agriculture called regenerative agriculture that can reverse damage to the environment. It involves raising livestock and people eating meat.\nCurrent conventional agriculture uses artificial fertilizer which is made from non-renewable resources and creates a huge amount of emissions. It destroys soil, air, and water. Regenerative agriculture, on the other hand, functions more like an natural ecosystem. Ruminants graze on grassland and their manure acts as a natural fertilizer which builds up soil quality and sequesters carbon. Grassland is healthier when animals are properly grazed on it which in turn improves air and water. People then eat the ruminants or use them as a source of milk.\nWe certainly do need to stop producing both animal and plant based food the way that we currently do. It is destructive and inefficient. But all the vegan factoids about how bad it is to eat meat are based on assuming that food will continue to be produced this way. Merely refraining from eating animal products while continuing to raise plants with conventional agriculture is not going to fix problems with the environment. All agriculture, both plant and animal, needs reform. And if we do this, then eating meat will not be harmful to the environment, but rather beneficial.\n592 viewsView upvotes\n1 of 2 answers\n10\n2",

When you learn that the polar bears are not dying from receding ice, that Kilimanjaro is not melting because of global warming, that hurricanes are not increasing in number, that neither are tornadoes, that malaria is not spreading from the heat -- it is tempting to throw out everything. When you were told back in 1999 that the recent surge in temperature was our last warning (we now know it was a short burst due to El Nino), and that if we didn't act in the next 5 years it would be forever too late -- and then you learn that here in 2015 it still isn't too late -- you are tempted to think the whole thing is nonsense.\nThe problem is that scientists have become advocates and they have been spinning the data, to emphasize only the data that shows impending disaster, and not the data that counters it. In other words, too many scientists have been acting like politicians and lawyers, and as a result, much of the public has lost faith in scientists.\nI feel that the proper role of scientists is to present the data clearly, fairly, and objectively. Warming in the past 50 years has been less than 1 C, and that knowledge might cause some in the public to dismiss the danger. Scientists need to acknowledge that it has been small, but that expected increases in carbon dioxide emissions are about to accelerate the warming, and that the threat lies in the future. We have to trust the public and the politicians to understand what we say. When we exaggerate, we have a temporary effect (as did the movie \"An Inconvenient Truth\"), but when they discover that we scientists have been exaggerating, it is difficult to win back their trust.\n261.2K viewsView upvotesView 98 sharesAnswer requested by\nAustin Conlon\n7.6K\n98\n905",

They expect me to know the answer.\nThat is beyond absurd as there are no \u201dsolutions\u201d within our current systems. No one \u201dknows\u201d exactly what to do. That\u2019s the whole point. We can\u2019t just lower or heighten some taxes or invest in some \u201dgreen\u201d funds and go on like before.\nYes there are many many things that are very good and necessary, and improves the situation. Such as solar- and wind power, circular economy, veganism, sustainable farming and so on. But even those are just parts of a greater picture.\nWe can no longer only focus on individual and separate issues like electrical cars, nuclear power, meat, aviation, bio fuels etc etc. We urgently need a holistic view to adress the full sustainability crisis and the ongoing ecological disaster. And this is why I keep saying that we need to start treating the crisis as the crisis it is. Because only then - and only guided by the best available science (as is clearly stated throughout the Paris Agreement) can we together start creating the global way forward.\nBut that can never happen as long as we allow the \u201dyeah-but-what-about-nuclear-power-then-debate\u201d to go on and on and on. This is wasting our time. This is climate delayer-ism. We need to keep a great number of thoughts in our head at same time and yet move forward with the changes at unprecedented speed.\nPersonally I am against nuclear power, but according to the IPCC, it can be a small part of a very big new carbon free energy solution, especially in countries and areas that lack the possibility of a full scale renewable energy supply - even though its extremely dangerous, expensive and time consuming. But let\u2019s leave that debate until we start looking at the full picture.[1]\nIndeed she has stated that she is against nuclear power. So, why is she against it?\nTo understand this you need to understand the Swedish political landscape of the past 40 years, because nuclear energy is a hot button issue in Sweden, the support of which greatly fluctuates from year to year.\nTo summarize those 40 years, very crudely, the Swedish government used to not consider environmental issues to belong in the Riksdag, which alienated enough voters for the Environmentalist Party (Milj\u00f6partiet) to be elected, and they\u2019ve always been anti-nuclear. The Environmentalist Party remained essentially the only elected party which fought for environmental policies for about 2-3 decades, after which it found itself in a strategically important role in being a supporting party for the Social Democrats, in return for the Social Democrats supporting their environmental policies.\nEssentially, opposition towards nuclear power has dominated environmental discourse because of the neglect of environmental policies from the other parties, making support of nuclear power controversial.\nNow, let\u2019s return to the question.\nIf Greta Thunberg believes world leaders should listen to science's arguments, then why doesn't she support the diffusion of nuclear energy?\nWe\u2019ve already gone over what she herself cites as her reasons for opposing it (\u201c\u2026 its extremely dangerous, expensive and time consuming\u201d), and had a brief overlook of the political climate she is from, which further explains her position.\nThe thing is though, Greta is not a world leader. Her position on nuclear power is ultimately irrelevant, as she doesn\u2019t want, nor claim to want, to be the one who\u2019s opinion defines the path we take to combat climate change. On top of which she is not yet even eligible to vote, and when she is she'll be voting in a country that very likely can combat climate change without nuclear power.\nEven so, she\u2019s able to concede that the IPCC says that nuclear can be part of the solution - meaning she recognizes what scientists are saying, even when that contradicts her personal opinion, which is more than one can say of her opponents.\nEdit: I'm going to be deleting all climate change denying comments that i see, because the facts are no longer up for debate. I will also delete any comments i see that insult Greta. You're entitled to disagree with her as much as you like, but i will not tolerate adults insulting children.\nEdit 2: I will also be blocking anyone who complains about the edit above. My answer, my comment section, my rules.\nFootnotes\n[1] Greta Thunberg\n108.1K viewsView upvotesView 20 shares",

            "text": "The ROI is too low. Nuclear is among the most expensive sources of electrical power.\nThere are such enormous cost overruns and delays that projects either get canceled or tax-payers get stuck with the bill.\nEven if we spent much more money learning to make it more efficient and cheap, the \u201clearning curve\u201d is still solidly above other cheaper alternatives.\nYou might say \u201cstupid voters and public opinion is what is blocking nuclear.\u201d If that were true, then you might expect China to be investing a ton in nuclear, without public opinion blocking them.\nOh, wait - it looks like they are planning on investing much more in renewables like wind and solar. Nuclear is there as well, but just isn\u2019t cost-effective enough to be the main source of energy, even for such a powerful country as china.[1][2]\nNuclear power generates electricity and is a manageable component on grids, so it\u2019s there with wind and solar too. They have different characteristics of electricity generation and ancillary services, but the differences don\u2019t actually make nuclear better or worse, just different.\nIt\u2019s low carbon, low pollution and has low mortality rates, so those are good things. It\u2019s down there with wind and solar on those points.\nUnfortunately, it\u2019s too expensive and too slow to build. Compared to wind and solar, it\u2019s 3\u20135 times more costly per MWh and takes 3\u20135 times as much to build capacity capable of generating the same GWh of electricity every year. That means it can\u2019t compete with them. This median build time for nuclear is around a decade right now. We actually need to be generating a lot more clean electricity a lot sooner than a decade or two from now.\nAnd then there are the fiscal risks. Pretty much every nuclear plant built has gone over budget and over schedule. The industry is riddled with overruns that were swept under various budgetary carpets. Ontario still has $20 billion in nuclear debt on the books. France\u2019s Macron is on record saying he was never able to get a straight answer on how much they spent.\nAnd the other fiscal risk is liability. In the USA, it\u2019s capped at $13 billion for private insurers, and after that it\u2019s on the taxpayer. Given that Fukushima is going to be pushing a trillion USD by the time all the costs are counted, that\u2019s a lot of taxpayer liability. Most rational governments aren\u2019t interested in that, regardless of probability.\nIn 2009, it was possible to squint, think that nuclear was going to be key to the climate change solution set and have a defensible argument. But it\u2019s 2019. We have global empirical evidence now. Nuclear isn\u2019t needed. It\u2019s too expensive and too slow to build compared to wind and solar, and its characteristics aren\u2019t helpful on modern grids.\nAnybody promoting nuclear in 2019 is running a mental model which is empirically unsound, likely one that they haven\u2019t updated for a decade as more data has arisen. They are biased thinkers.\n~ Michael Barnard's answer to Why isn\u2019t nuclear energy talked about as frequently in the conversation of renewable energy sources?\nFootnotes\n[1] World Energy Outlook 2017 China : Key Findings\n[2] https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Sources-of-future-power-generation-in-China-under-the-International-Renewable-Energy_fig3_314131525 (https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Sources-of-future-power-generation-in-China-under-the-International-Renewable-Energy_fig3_314131525)\n388 viewsView upvotes",

I am pro in am idealist sense because I think it can lead us to future opportunities, a station on mars might run better on nuclear, this sort of argument.\nThe big problem with nuclear energy other than price compared to others is that because of potential defence transfer it requires a kind of closed engineering community that is not therefore able to innovate and improve quality of work in the same way more open sectors do.\nI believe this is one of the reasons so much innovation in nuclear happened early on.

            "text": "Nuclear Energy is a massive red herring. From the perspective of high-level energy policy, it\u2019s strictly worse than renewables in pretty much every meaningful way.\nIf you do even a little bit of research that becomes obvious really fast, and it really bothers me that I've seen a distinct group of scientists, usually physicists, who are vocal proponents. The scientific and engineering evidence about nuclear energy is surprisingly negative, in an area that's usually pretty vague. Not highly negative, but conclusive nonetheless.\nHere is a plot of the Levelized Cost of Energy, which accounts for things like partial capacity due to fluctuations:\nI highlighted Advanced Combined Cycle because that\u2019s the term for modern Natural Gas powerplants. That\u2019s considered a transitional energy source, and it\u2019s pretty much what\u2019s killing coal plants in the US.\nIf you want to have a viable alternative energy source, you need to beat that price. That\u2019s not speculative either, there are plenty of studies that investigate that in order to study the impact of energy subsidies. For example: Are renewable energy subsidies effective? Evidence from Europe\nNuclear energy fails strongly in that area nowadays, and its yearly installed capacity reflects that.\nEven without subsidies, Wind energy meets or beats the price of Natural Gas, and Hydroelectric is right there as well. Solar is a little expensive, but there\u2019s a pretty wide range and the price is dropping.\nHydroelectric installations are rare because the resource is very highly-exploited in the US, but new wind and solar generation is getting added in record amounts.\nSo nuclear loses on price, and isn't economically viable. Well, what about all of the capacity fluctuations from renewables? Isn\u2019t nuclear better?\nNo, it\u2019s not.\nNuclear energy delivers a fairly constant amount of power, but that\u2019s not actually a benefit. The idea that you want a specific level of production is a myth, based on bad understanding of the design requirements for power grids.\nDemand actually fluctuates a lot, and there\u2019s a massive amount of research on trying to quantify that fluctuation. The earliest papers go back decades, and you can still find a lot of recent work because we haven\u2019t fully solved it yet: A framework for baseline load estimation in demand response: Data mining approach\nIn the absence of energy storage, you need generation that can match the changes in demand, not just produce a consistent amount of power. It turns out nuclear is really bad at that - this research paper goes into potential avenues for starting development of load-following nuclear, and it was just published in 2015: http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/91139/1/Accpeted%20version.pdf\nSo a grid using just nuclear energy isn\u2019t really viable. Even in France, where the percentage of nuclear generation is very high and the reactors are state of the art, there\u2019s still a lot of other sources to manage the capacity issues:\nThat high percentage of hydro power is really important, because pumped storage facilities\nare the only viable grid-scale source of storage we have right now, and dams can regulate how much water they release to store up energy, so they help to level out peaks and troughs in demand.\nMeanwhile, the fluctuations in renewable generation are usually overblown and misunderstood. The engineering community is completely on top of that issue.\nWind energy actually naturally solves some of its generation problems if you just keep installing more of it. The individual turbines fluctuate a lot, but the system as a whole produces a significantly more constant amount of power. As long as you only expect to get 30% of your installed capacity, then wind is fairly consistent.\nAnd the costs I listed at the beginning are \u201clevelized\u201d to take that into account.\nThere is a lot of research on quantifying the grid design required for wind energy, or for a hybrid wind+solar approach, and we have a pretty robust understanding of how to get from where we are to 100% renewables:\nSpectrum of Wind Power Fluctuations\nCapacity allocation of a hybrid energy storage system for power system peak shaving at high wind power penetration level\nHybrid wind/photovoltaic energy system developments: Critical review and findings\nIt\u2019s not that it isn\u2019t a challenge, but it\u2019s one that we\u2019ve studied well. We\u2019re actually past the point of feasibility studies and on into more targeted proposals for implementation.\nIt\u2019s doable with current technology, the main issue is economic viability.\nSo yeah, there\u2019s no reason for developed countries to use nuclear energy beyond people being dogmatic. There\u2019s no significant problem that it\u2019s solving, and there\u2019s no benefit over other options.\nUsually it's strictly worse.\n4.2K viewsView upvotes",

Calling them climate change deniers is absurd and probably unhelpful.\nSome scientists have recently stepped up their predictions and claim by as early as 2025 there could be irreversible climate change of up to 2 degrees. This will cause crop failures and the loss of up to 10% of arable land. These are worse case scenarios, but it can be argued we should plan for the worst case.\nHow Thunberg and others get from there to an Extinction Event is by hypothesising that the resulting famines will lead to a Thermonuclear War, and hence Everyone Dies.\nI strongly suspect that there are more than a few CND members in Extinction Rebellion. Much of the rhetoric is the same, as is their apparent assumption there is a World Government which can unilaterally force change, which can be influenced by protesting primarily in English speaking countries.\nWhile nuclear power can be achieved without producing nuclear weapons, there has always been an association between the two, and groups like CND have campaigned against both.\nOne thing ER seem blind to is that their suggested solutions, of Overthrowing Capitalism and essentially banning all forms of travel and global shipping, would also lead to famines, economic collapse and potentially war.\nAnother way to avoid the impacts of climate change is to plan for it. If 10% of arable land does disappear, we should be investing in farming production and so on, and increasing the capacity to move food from one place to another.\n183 viewsView upvotes",

            "text": "I will try to answer the question by addressing the opposite: What vegan foods do not harm animals indirectly?\nHuman-consumed vegan foods don\u2019t technically have to be harmful, directly or indirectly, to any animal. Foraging, if you know what you\u2019re doing, is a good start. It helps if you live somewhere where the native flora are able to provide good nutrition, including vitamin B12 from unwashed fruit/veg or an environmentally-sound supplement manufacturer.\nWhat about kitchen gardens? Copper strips repel above-ground slugs but cause them a bit of harm (reversible). Use netting to ward against foraging animals. Although considered environmentally friendly, even use of natural predators such as nematodes and ladybirds are harmful to animals, but you can grow plenty of things, in sufficient quantity, without requiring natural predators or harmful repellents. If you\u2019re careful and do thorough research you can survive off a kitchen garden and foraging without harming animals.\nBe careful with things like rhubarb. The leaves are terribly toxic but if you plant them in reach of a rabbits you may get some nibbling at the leaves. I don\u2019t know if in my case the rabbits survived, but I am sure that some harm was caused.\nIf you are buying any vegan food from a supermarket they are most likely to be causing animals indirect harm.\nAmongst the worst are soy- and palm-derived products. By purchasing items containing soy or palm (with few exceptions) you are technically contributing to their value/demand and directly raising the incentive to do further irreversible damage to the most valuable natural habitats - rainforests and mangroves respectively. Vegans tend to use lecithin to supplement for choline, which unfortunately is most commonly and affordably found as a soy-derived, as opposed to sunflower-derived, product.\nHarms animals.\nIntensive farming methods; monocultures, pesticides, landscape management, water management.\nHarms animals.\nOrganic food generally uses animal blood and bones as fertilisers.\nHarms animals.\nWhy? That stuff isn\u2019t provided for free, and comes from farmed animals. Anything that increases their value, even if it is from end of life dairy cows, increases the incentive to have more animals being raised, or not reduce the number raised. The market is not economically perfect, but as a vegan, it certainly helps to be aware that the potential for animal harm certainly exists and not get caught out on that point when discussing this with non-vegans and the anti-organic crowd. How does organic vs non-organic compare in terms of environmental/animal harm? It\u2019s a difficult question and it depends on a case-by-case basis (not even crop-by-crop).\nTransport of food by vehicles.\nHarms animals.\nNot just in terms of carbon emissions, or even the resources used in manufacturing or maintaining transport facilities, but also the insects that get crushed when these things operate.\nArtificially heated/lit greenhouses (esp. those with carbon-based fuel).\nHarms animals.\nBasically anything that leads to increased pollution (light, chemical or otherwise) or greenhouse gases indirectly causes animals harm. Anything that causes environmental change or damage will almost always harm animals. This includes farming practices which promote soil nutrient depletion. And what about the people employed at the shop or involved in the production or transport of food which may otherwise be animal-harm-free? If they eat or do things that harm animals, then perhaps you are also facilitating or incentivising that harm?\nIt is an interesting question, but beyond growing or foraging the food yourself, I think it\u2019s safe to assume any other food has caused indirect harm to an animal. Accurately quantifying harm, not that this was asked, is almost impossible, and arguably, with all due respect, not too valuable an exercise.\n3K viewsView upvotes",

            "text": "Originally Answered: Is there any vegan foods that indirectly harm animals?\nYes. Palm oil is a good example. Unsustainable palm oil production is a major cause of deforestation in Southeast Asia. Orangutans are severely affected by palm oil plantations. Many of them are killed by farmers and die because of habitat loss. Palm oil can be produced in a sustainable way, but it is good practice to avoid foods that include it, especially if you are unsure of its origin.\nAs already written in other responses, a lot of animals that are considered pests are culled to preserve the plant harvest. However, considering that a significant proportion of world\u2019s crops are fed to farmed animals, non-vegan lifestyle still harms many, many more animals than a vegan one. Plus, wild animals are also culled for animal farming. Killing wolves to preserve livestock is a common example.\nBeing vegan is not about being perfect. It is about harm reduction. We may be unable to avoid every single product made with animal ingredients, same as it is difficult to completely eliminate products of human exploitation, or things that are environmentally destructive. But most animal-derived products can be avoided or replaced, so if we can avoid harm, why would\u2019t we?\n1.6K viewsView upvotes",

            "text": "When adopting a vegan lifestyle, one typically aims to reduce direct harm to animals by avoiding products derived from them. However, it's essential to be aware that certain vegan foods may indirectly contribute to animal harm. Understanding these factors can help make more informed choices as conscientious consumers.\nPalm Oil Products: Many vegan foods contain palm oil, which has led to significant deforestation and habitat destruction in regions like Southeast Asia. This deforestation has adverse effects on wildlife, including endangered species like orangutans, tigers, and rhinos. As responsible vegans, we can choose products that use sustainably sourced palm oil or opt for alternatives altogether.\nSoy and Crop Farming: The mass production of soy and other crops used in vegan products can lead to land clearing and displacement of wildlife. Additionally, the use of pesticides and fertilizers can harm local ecosystems, impacting animals like insects, birds, and small mammals.\nQuinoa Production: The increasing demand for quinoa, a popular vegan protein source, has resulted in higher prices for local communities in South America. This has led to a shift in agricultural practices and a reduction in traditional animal husbandry, affecting llamas, alpacas, and other livestock.\nMonoculture Farming: Some large-scale vegan food production relies on monoculture farming practices, where vast areas of land are dedicated to a single crop. This practice can disrupt local ecosystems, reduce biodiversity, and negatively impact animals dependent on diverse habitats.\nTransportation and Packaging: While not directly related to the food itself, the transportation and packaging of vegan products can contribute to pollution and harm wildlife. Choosing locally sourced and minimally packaged items can help mitigate this impact.\nRegarding vegan food options in Los Angeles, \"The Vegan Joint\" stands out as an excellent choice for conscious eaters. With its commitment to plant-based cuisine and a wide array of delicious vegan offerings, \"The Vegan Joint\" provides a satisfying dining experience that minimizes direct and indirect harm to animals and the environment.\nIn conclusion, as we strive to reduce animal harm through our dietary choices, it's essential to be aware of the indirect effects certain vegan foods can have on animals and the environment. By opting for ethically sourced and sustainable options, like those offered by \"The Vegan Joint,\" we can foster positive change and support a more compassionate food system.\n31 viewsView upvotes",

            "text": "Most all food production, indeed all activities of life, involve some harm. We step on insects while walking, etc. That's why Jain monks wear breathing masks (to avoid inhaling any insects) and have an assistant to sweep the ground free of any bugs when they walk (which seems utterly hypocritical, since nobody is sweeping the ground in front of the assistant - it's clearly not about reducing harm but avoiding bad karma for the monk).\nBut for most vegans, the idea is to reduce harm, not eliminate it.\nFurther, there is inevitably a scale of harm. Humans are at the top - we simply do not eat humans, no matter how yummy and delicious. Plants are at the bottom - they are the least sentient, so since we need to eat something, it's perfectly okay to eat plants. (Although am I the only person who thinks that after living for hundreds of years, something like a giant sequoia might not have a level of sentience of its own and should be accorded a certain amount of respect?)\nAnimals vary greatly in sentience. Most people are instinctively repelled by the idea of eating great apes and cetaceans, the two classes of animal that seem as sentient as us. We also tend to feel it is wrong to eat endangered animals (which would now include most large non-domesticated mammals).\nMost of us don't eat dogs and cats because as our pets, we are aware of their sentience - their intelligence and ability to feel and love.\nThe only thing stopping us treating our domestic livestock with the same respect is a willful refusal to acknowledge their sentience, because we love the way they taste and would just rather not give them up. But if you personally get to know a cow, sheep, pig or chicken, they are really no different from our pets - some are possibly more intelligent.\nThis is true of many fish and birds as well. If you keep these as pets, you know how smart they are, and capable of relationships. Actually, some birds are more intelligent than primates in some ways.\nGetting down to rodents, insects, worms, etc (the most numerous victims of agriculture), they seem far less sentient. I'm not saying we should just slaughter them for the fun of it, but who can't see that if you have to inadvertently kill some creature in order eat, it's better to kill some worms and beetles than a polar bear or an elephant?\n195 viewsView upvotes",

            "text": "This is a bit of a loaded question that gets at the pitfalls of the way many of us think about food issues.\nWe all tend to think of individual food preferences in terms of complete ideologies, which is why vegetarianism and veganism are isms, when they\u2019re really just personal choices and preferences people make for personal reasons. They are not really and should not be judged as complete analyses or some form of Theory of Everything.\nUnfortunately, neither humans nor other animals can function without negatively impacting on other species or things. To grow veggies, we have to take land out of wilderness and manage it to exclude many insects and other animals that would eat the food we grow. Even if we only forage for food, we are usually taking materials other species would like to have.\nThis is how nature works, why evolution happens. It is the way of the world.\nHumans have a rare ability to produce food and manage the way they produce food to minimize harm to other people and creatures, and to maintain balance in ecosystems. That is what sustainable diets are about.\nBut we can't manage in ways that eliminate all damage to all creatures and things because we can't eat without manipulating environments in some way with tools. Tools substitute for our lack of claws, speed, wings and so on, and we wouldn't survive without them. Tools allow us to manipulate environments.\nVeganism is one way to reduce unnecessarily negative impacts. Organic is another way. Fair trade is another way. We should explore them all. We should be self righteous about none of them. We should be humble with our responsibility and graceful with our power.\n2K viewsView upvotes",

            "text": "Originally Answered: Is there any vegan foods that indirectly harm animals?\nSo as to be expected the anti-vegan lobby are relishing answering this question again. Obviously all sorts of animals are harmed or killed everyday by vegans and non-vegans alike. All plant production on a commercial scale requires some form of pest control or fertilisation. There are farmers trying to use methods that have as little impact on animals as possible such as farmers using veganic farming methods but even that normally requires burning of feeder crops like clover on occasion and many insects would die in the process. No vegan claims death is not involved in the production of their food. Their food doesn't however involve the wholesale slaughter of animals just to please their palate.\nWhy do anti-vegans love this question? Well the reasoning goes like this : \u201cAnimals are killed by vegans; they just don't know it(subtext : stupid vegans : they should eat meat; it will feed their brains). They spend all this time avoiding meat, milk,eggs and shunning animal derived clothing yet each plate of greens they eat has resulted in many deaths. Small rodents are killed in the harvesting process and millions of insects are killed to grow their crops. So stupid. I mean isn't that hypocritical? I\u2019m so glad I'm an omnivore. They may as well eat meat like the rest of us; life involves death anyway, just one of those things. Oh shame, bunny huggers hey? Oh well, it takes all sorts\u201d.\nSo this is a case of if you can't do everything you may as well do nothing.\nVeganism results in less suffering; no one claims it results in no suffering.\nAlso look to the answer comparing standard plant production against pasture raised animals. So we must now compare the vegan option that causes most deaths to the farming method that ostensibly causes least deaths. How convenient. How many animals are actually pasture raised? In the United States 99% of all animals are factory farmed. Worldwide the % sits at 70%.\nThere simply isn't enough land in the world to raise pasture fed animals to meet human demand and with a growing human population the demand for land for human development means those pastures will be getting smaller and smaller.\nPalm oil results in deforestation. But do only vegans eat palm oil? No. Yet this is also often thrown in vegans faces to showcase their hypocrisy. Many vegans also avoid palm oil; it doesn't make you a non-vegan if you don't.\nBottom line : it's a tired argument riddled with logical fallacies. Vegan food production like all food production results in death to some creatures, vegans just try contribute to minimising the suffering and unnecessary death of sentient creatures to the extent practicable.\n4.1K viewsView upvotesView 8 shares",

            "text": "A vegan lifestyle reduces harm to animals both directly and indirectly. Nobody ever said a vegan lifestyle/diet is perfect but it does reduce animal suffering, captivity, death and environmental harms. A vegan diet revolves around reduction of animal and environmental harm. Many answers actively seek to make vegan diet something negative when studies and research show that it\u2019s highly positive.\n\u201cThey have shown that reductions in meat consumption and other dietary changes would ease pressure on land use (11, 12) and reduce GHG emissions (7, 11\u201314).\u201d (Pnas)\n\u201cA major report on land use and climate change says the West's high consumption of meat and dairy produce is fueling global warming.\u201d (BBC, Harrabin).\n\u201cLivestock rearing contributes to global warming through the methane gas the animals produce, but also via deforestation to expand pastures..\u201d (BBC, Harrabin).\nYou have to also understand that meat consumption is increasing due to overpopulation. The demand for pasture raised/grass fed animals is not realistic for the world. Not only does it increase global warming (which causes harm to many animals by destroying their homes) but it\u2019s just not sustainable.\nAnother huge problem is that grass fed beef leads in deforestation.\n\u201cRaising grass-fed cows also leads to deforestation \u2013 another big climate change issue \u2013 as farmers chop down forests in order to expand their pastures.\u201d\n\u201cGrass fed\u201d does not mean that it was totally grass fed. Many of the wheat/corn crops actually go to these animals, to make them big enough to kill. Farmers don\u2019t have the resources to raise purely pasture raised animals. Hence the increase in factory farming.\n\u201cAlmost 50 percent of the grains produced in the world are fed to livestock, yet there remain about 800 million people suffering from hunger and malnutrition mostly in the developing countries.\u201d (fao)\nFactory farming is just unacceptable. Most of the meat/eggs/dairy that people consume come from factory farming. If you just spend one day there, you will come to see why so many people turn to vegan lifestyles. Not only are these animals slaughtered, they are also tortured.\nAnother issue is that many companies want to sell their products without making consumers feel guilty. What they do is label their eggs \u201cfree range\u201d even though that basically means nothing. Just because the chickens were free range does not mean they were not tortured or in pain.\nSources:\nYour grass-fed burger is making climate change worse\nhttps://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/113/15/4146.full.pdf\nPlant-based diet can fight climate change - UN\nHarvard Study Finds Shift to Grass-Fed Beef Would Require 30% More Cattle and Increase Beef's Methane Emissions 43%\nLivestock - a driving force for food security and sustainable development\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aad401/pdf\nhttps://www.animalsaustralia.org/features/lets-talk-about-climate-change.php\n1.9K viewsView upvotesView 2 shares",

Here, it is the difference between purposefully ramming people down in France with a truck, vs accidentally ramming another car with a truck. We consider accidents a byproduct of driving, not a direct result of it. When we use pesticides, the purpose of it is to keep our lettuce safe, not to murder bugs. When we harvest wheat, it is to eat it, not to starve mice, etc.\n2: The scope. Most, not all, but most animals raised fall into either 1 of 2 categories - grain fed (vast majority where I live), or from hacked and slashed land (e.g. cattle farming in the Amazon).\nIn the case of the first, cattle take in roughly 12x the food they produce, so whatever argument is used is multiplied by 12x + 1 (the cow being the +1).\nIn the latter, you are actively destroying large areas of natural land for a very inefficient food system (meat).\nAs you can see from both of those things - human life directly causes harm to animals, veganism minimizes it.\n1.1K viewsView upvotes",

As the same grown in India with simple ancient techniques is harmless.\nThe answers here are misleading as they are talking about wrong organic farming techniques used in the US. The Indian technology is to use natural materials like cow dung and urine in combination with shredded vegetable matter to create fertilizers. When we avoid urea (which is sweet in smell and attracts bugs) we prevent insect infections.\nThere is however harm done to plants themselves in certain cases. If we include the plants as well and decide not to harm them in the process then there are cases to consider.\nAny lentils or grass grown seeds like rice is grown by killing the plant after harvesting.\nA banana plant grows bananas only once and is killed as it becomes useless to us after harvesting.\nAny underground food item like potatoes, carrots, groundnuts, onions are harvested by uprooting the plant and killing it.\nSome spices like coriander leaves, mint leaves are harvested by uprooting the entire shrub.\nMany fruit trees are pruned to increase production.\nThere are religions like Jainism that avoid food items that harm the plants.

Every time you take a shower, or wash your clothes, stand up or sit down, you harm animals.

You can use biological pest control - putting in some animals to eat others - but it\u2019s still you who is responsible for that happening. Indoors, well, the greenhouse had to be built out of something, and the manufacturing process, without a doubt, harmed animals.

            "text": "As others have said: All of them.\nWe have this thing called the circle of life. Bugs pollinate plants, herbivores eat plants, carnivores eat herbivores, all of them die and fertilize the earth to grow more plants, etc. etc. Veganism hurts this cycle. Even being Vegetarian hurts this cycle.\nThe human race has drastically altered this cycle on its own. We have wiped out countless species of predators and herbivores both on our path to development and expansion. Habitats destroyed, species gone extinct. Now we like to put any dangerous predators in zoos or preserves where they can\u2019t hurt us, and are fun to look at. At the same time, we mass produce herbivores every single day to make our food.\nIf vegans/vegetarians had their way, none of these herbivores would be killed. They would be released into the wild free of human \u201ccruelty.\u201d And then starts the cycle of death, instead. These herbivores are already overpopulated because we grow them for food. Because we\u2019ve taken most, if not all of their predators away, their herds will continue to grow exponentially, unchecked. Now, if you\u2019re vegan, that probably means you don\u2019t want hunters to kill them for sport or food. So there\u2019s basically nothing to stop their numbers from growing, and growing, until.. Starvation. The herds have grown so large that they have consumed all of the vegetation in the area and basically rendered it barren. Disease will set in as they grow weak, and they will all die slowly of either hunger or sickness, because they had no predators to keep them from overpopulating and destroying their own habitat. They can try and move, and continue to destroy more habitats in their never-ending need for consumption. Animals don\u2019t know how to plant new crops so they would only ever consume, never produce. Humans could try and burn resources to keep them fed, but the more they feed the more their population grows, and eventually even we run out of resources, and now we starve, too.\nUnless we kill them. Ourselves. And preferably make them into food, so that the resources they consumed haven\u2019t gone to waste.\nThere are smaller examples of this in real life. Deer populations that grow too large and require hunters to come in and kill them because we\u2019ve already hunted their predators to low numbers, if not extinction. But worldwide veganism would cause this to happen on a\u2014you guessed it\u2014worldwide scale. And if we can\u2019t kill the over-consuming herbivores, they will literally eat the planet bare. And then not only do the herbivores die slowly and painfully of starvation and disease, but so does just about every other animal, too, including humans. Vegan means we can\u2019t eat animal products, or the animals.. and now there\u2019s no more vegetation. We have nothing left to eat, so we die. If we assume we never wisen up and learn that we need to kill and eat these animals to survive\u2014either that or re-institute real predators and leave them the hell alone\u2014the human race will go extinct, and the world will basically have to start over from what few species remain. If they can\u2019t manage it, Earth becomes a dead planet. Lifeless. Barren.\nPlease, keep our planet healthy. Support humane slaughterhouses that treat their animals decently while alive, and kill their livestock as painlessly as possible, without tainting the meat.

We eat and breathe, consuming oxygen and exhaling a mixture containing more CO2 than we took in because of the energy we extracted from the plant material that produced the food, either directly or second hand from the meat animals we eat which in turn add to the CO2 and methane.\nBut it is all relative even with cars. All cars are built using carbon producing methods. Building EVs at present does use a bit more carbon output to produce, but that is changing as we roll out more and more electrified versions of all machines currently using IC engines.\nThe electric cars produced by those methods will last longer, need no oil changes for that longer lifespan and will not cost our children\u2019s health due to asthma, that is one of the hidden costs of our current mix of vehicles in heavily populated areas. Once the car is built, it is climate neutral, and the more we replace the ones that are much worse, the sooner our climate temperature rise problems will be neutralized. We cannot afford to do less than that, and we should do more than that in many other areas. Meat consumption like I knew in the 1950s, when it was only once per day or less, would go a long way towards a more healthy world in both the human health consequences, and the carbon emissions.\nUsing pick-up trucks for their design functions instead of glorified personal transport would be a much needed improvement too.

            "text": "Related\nCan becoming a vegan save the planet from permanent damage done from climate change?\nNo. The opposite is true. There is a kind of agriculture called regenerative agriculture that can reverse damage to the environment. It involves raising livestock and people eating meat.\nCurrent conventional agriculture uses artificial fertilizer which is made from non-renewable resources and creates a huge amount of emissions. It destroys soil, air, and water. Regenerative agriculture, on the other hand, functions more like an natural ecosystem. Ruminants graze on grassland and their manure acts as a natural fertilizer which builds up soil quality and sequesters carbon. Grassland is healthier when animals are properly grazed on it which in turn improves air and water. People then eat the ruminants or use them as a source of milk.\nWe certainly do need to stop producing both animal and plant based food the way that we currently do. It is destructive and inefficient. But all the vegan factoids about how bad it is to eat meat are based on assuming that food will continue to be produced this way. Merely refraining from eating animal products while continuing to raise plants with conventional agriculture is not going to fix problems with the environment. All agriculture, both plant and animal, needs reform. And if we do this, then eating meat will not be harmful to the environment, but rather beneficial.\n593 viewsView upvotes\n1 of 2 answers\n10\n2",

The problem isn't meat it's the terrible way we raise them with substandard feed and no concern for the environment. It can be done beneficially, it just isn't. Lastly growing grain and the annual vegetables we eat is ALSO causing significant environmental destruction, carbon emissions, and destroying valuable perennial grasslands which sequester more carbon per acre than a forest. Veganism isn't a fix it is nothing more than an ineffective band-aid that will keep civillization going a few more years rather than actually addressing the problem and fixing the inherent problems with our entire food production system. As it stands they are not part of the solution they are part of the problem because they are confusing and conflating the issue rather than identifying the underlying disease and treating it they are only treating the systems while the cancer that is our unsustainability grows.\n117 viewsView upvotes\n1 of 6 answers\n5",

What we do know is that the common ancestor of domestic cattle, the great auroch, was much larger (weighing around 2,000 lbs on average) and hunted, to extinction, by humans for many many many years. Likely, some auroch calves were raised by humans, or mild-tempered individuals were kept in close proximity and, ultimately bred. Hand-rearing and selecting for human-friendly temperament is the standard way that people have domesticated all of the animals that have \"co-evolved\" with us, so to speak.\n3.4K viewsView upvotes\n1 of 4 answers\nYour response is private\nWas this worth your time?\nThis helps us sort answers on the page.\nAbsolutely not\nDefinitely yes\n9\n1",
